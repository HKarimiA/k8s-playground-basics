== Overview

=== Pods
A Pod (not container) is the smallest building-block/worker-unit in Kubernetes, it has a specification of one or more containers and exists for the duration of the containers; if all the containers stop or terminate, the Pod is stopped. Check also https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/

=== Deployments
Usually a pod will be part of a Deployment; a more controlled or robust way of running Pods. A deployment can be configured to automatically delete stopped or exited Pods and start new ones, as well as run a number of identical Pods e.g. to provide high-availability. Check https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/


=== StatefulSets
Basically like a deployment but with static identifiers for the pod identity. Usefull for stable network names, using of storage, ordered rollouts / updates. https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/


=== DaemonSet

Used to run pods on all or specific k8s nodes with specific features. if k8s nodes are attached or removed they will also added or removed. https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/


== Exercise: Run a stateless Application Using a Deployment

Check the documentation here https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/run-stateless-application-deployment/ and provide the deployment in our `training` namespace.

== Solution:
```shell
# create deployment yaml file
cat <<EOF >>deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  replicas: 2 # tells deployment to run 2 pods matching the template
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
EOF

# Create a Deployment based on the YAML file in training namespace
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml -n training
```
